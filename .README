This is my attempt to create a workflow involving LLM's. The goal is to provide a library for myself (or others)
to automate scheduling for personal, academic, and professional use cases with Motion. It can take a lot of work to maintain a 
schedule or agenda and I wanted to leverage recent AI advances to make the process feel less tedious.

Every course and professor provides a syllabus with all relevant course information. The problem is that these generally come in a variety of formats making
a traditional workflow for automation difficult. With LLM's we can simplify this process by allowing an AI agent to extract text
and make decisions about what to do with that data. By getting an agent to break down schedules into a standard JSON format, we 
can then use this JSON to interact with the Motion REST API. Motion provides a flexible and automated scheduling service that 
will intelligently schedule any extracted tasks.
